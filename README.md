This app allows a user to take photos around the city and be able to view the photos as pins on a map view.
This app cotains three tabs: map, camera, and album.
* Map
    - displays a map view that has pins of the previously taken photos
    - tapping on a pin will have a little popup that shows the image
* Camera
    - opens a camera interface that allows the user to take a photo
* Album
    - a collection view that shows each photo taken organized into locations
    - tapping on each cell should bring the user to a view that shows more deatils of the location
